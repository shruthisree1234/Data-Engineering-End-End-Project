**Data Platform Architecture**
SoftCart uses a hybrid architecture, with some of its databases on premises and some on cloud.

Tools and Technologies:
OLTP database - MySQL
NoSql database - MongoDB
Production Data warehouse – DB2 on Cloud
Staging Data warehouse – PostgreSQL
Big data platform - Hadoop
Big data analytics platform – Spark
Business Intelligence Dashboard - IBM Cognos Analytics
Data Pipelines - Apache Airflow
Process:
SoftCart's online presence is primarily through its website, which customers access using a variety of devices like laptops, mobiles and tablets.

All the catalog data of the products is stored in the MongoDB NoSQL server.

All the transactional data like inventory and sales are stored in the MySQL database server.

SoftCart's webserver is driven entirely by these two databases.

Data is periodically extracted from these two databases and put into the staging data warehouse running on PostgreSQL.

The production data warehouse is on the cloud instance of IBM DB2 server.

BI teams connect to the IBM DB2 for operational dashboard creation. IBM Cognos Analytics is used to create dashboards.

SoftCart uses Hadoop cluster as its big data platform where all the data is collected for analytics purposes.

Spark is used to analyse the data on the Hadoop cluster.

To move data between OLTP, NoSQL and the data warehouse, ETL pipelines are used and these run on Apache Airflow.

**OLTP DATABASE DESIGN REQUIREMENTS**

OLTP database requirements and design
OLTP database
OLTP database is generally used to handle every day business transactions of an organization like a bank or a super market chain. OLTP databases can be write heavy or may have a balanced read/write load.

OLTP database requirements:
An OLTP database is expected to handle a huge number of transactions per second. Each transaction usually involves accessing (read/write) a small portion of the database, in other words the payload per transaction is small.

The time taken to execute a transaction usually called latency needs to be very less.

OLTP database design:
The schema of an OLTP database is higly normalized so as to achieve a very low latency. To further improve the latency an OLTP database stores only the recent data like the last few week's data. They are usually run on storage that is very fast like SSD.
